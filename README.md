Sentimental Analysis of Twitter Tweets

The above python file is a console based application. Here Users can enter the topic they want to analyze and the application returns a bunch of tweets along with the Polarity of tweets and Subjectivity scores.

I thank Siraj Raval for this code and his youtube channel.

This application can be used to understand the sentiments of public on a particular topic. I plan on extending its functionalities. Anyone wanting to help me on this one is welcomed.
